Version 1.02: Major Update
* SolidIndexes is now split into two ASM files to improve readability; due to this, labels for Sonic & Knuckles collision data has been added to Sonic 3 Alone (though they point to the same location).

Version 1.01: First Update
* Sonic 3 levels now use the interleaved Sonic & Knuckles collision format; affects Sonic 3 Alone and Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

Version 1.00: Initial Release
* Moved all three games to the Sega 32X; made sure "lock-on technology" still functioned correctly.
